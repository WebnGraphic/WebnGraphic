            <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
              We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
              Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard
              options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
              functionality and features they add to this site. It is
              recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
              whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
              service that you use.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings
              on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be
              aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this
              and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will
              usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
              features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not
              disable cookies.
